Here are some tips to navigate through below concepts and material:

The skills under “Technical Knowledge” must be for any student joining Adobe. These are ordered by their criticality and usefulness. While most concepts and topics are taught to students in college by their faculties, they can take some additional courses on the side, especially for Java and Web Dev.
The skills under the “Adobe Products Knowledge” section are specific and relevant to students who wish to join Adobe now or at a later stage in their career.
We recommend all students learn about Adobe’s Digital Experience business (1st skill). Understanding the business offerings, applications of products, and revenue strategies will enhance their business acumen and open their minds to SaaS business models.
Adobe Experience Manager is the 2nd most sought-after skill across all job platforms.
